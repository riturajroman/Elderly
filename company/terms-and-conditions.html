              <p>
                Elderly’s relevance algorithm for the Practitioners is a fully
                automated system that lists the Practitioners, their profile and
                information regarding their Practice on its Elderly. These
                listings of Practitioners do not represent any fixed objective
                ranking or endorsement by Elderly. Elderly will not be liable
                for any change in the relevance of the Practitioners on search
                results, which may take place from time to time. The listing of
                Practitioners will be based on automated computation of the
                various factors including inputs made by the Users including
                their comments and feedback. Such factors may change from time
                to time, in order to improve the listing algorithm. Elderly in
                no event will be held responsible for the accuracy and the
                relevancy of the listing order of the Practitioners on the
                Elderly.
